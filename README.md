# 🌐 AlumnConnect

**Digital Platform for Centralised Alumni Data Management and Engagement**

It provides educational institutions with a reliable system to manage alumni relationships, fostering stronger engagement, enhancing fundraising, and creating valuable mentorship and networking opportunities for all stakeholders.

## 📝 Problem Statement

### Problem Description
Most educational institutions lack a reliable and centralised system to manage their alumni data. Once students graduate, their contact information, academic records, and career updates are often scattered across multiple platforms or lost entirely.  

In many cases, alumni communication is restricted to informal WhatsApp groups or outdated mailing lists, making long-term engagement difficult.  

This lack of a structured system limits the potential of alumni relationships. Institutions miss opportunities to involve alumni in events, mentoring, internships, or fundraising. In a digitally connected world, the absence of a proper alumni management system creates a significant gap in outreach and growth.
